      <p class="cs-text">
        My name's Adnan, I'm a web developer and the sole owner of Onkyoh Web
        Designs. My whole life I've had a keen interest in creating things with
        technology, so when I stumbled upon web design there was an instant
        click. I decided to start this business after seeing too many businesses
        with poorly built websites holding back their growth.
      </p>
      <p class="cs-text">
        I understand that many businesses may be reluctant or unable to invest
        thousands in a website. With this in mind, I've designed a pricing model
        specifically for small businesses, focusing on long-term growth. Instead
        of a large upfront cost, I offer a plan with no initial payment and a
        monthly fee of $150, making it more affordable and reflecting the
        ongoing value that a quality website can provide.

        While every developer says they are working in your best interest, I
        mean it. My pricing model gives you the option to walk away anytime
        after 6 months, so you can rest assured that I will make a website that
        is invested in your business's growth.
