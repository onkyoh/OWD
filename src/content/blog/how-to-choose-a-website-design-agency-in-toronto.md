## What kind of website does my business need?

If you're reading this you probably came to the realization that your business needs a website. Whether its to reach all potential customers, or just to strengthen your brand, a website is required for any serious business. 

The next step is figure out whether you should build and host your own website or hire a professional.

By working with a professional web design agency you should expect the following:

* A professionally designed website
* Search engine optimized and persuasive website content.
* An quick website that loads as fast as possible.

Most of all, you should benefit from **offloading the stress of web development to a professional,** so you can actually focus on your business.

The final step in this entire process is the most important, picking a website development company that will get the job done for a fair price. This blog post will break down the pricing, designs, and page speed of several Toronto-based web design agencies so you can make the right choice for your business.

### Pixelcarve

Pixelcarve is the right choice for a business that needs a unique design and is willing the cough up good money for it. Some appropriate clients include high-end services and sellers who aren't looking for a website to rank high on Google but instead want one that conveys luxury.



### Eggs Media

While Eggs Media's websites aren't works of art they demonstrate clear adherence to design principles. While the website speeds are held back due the website being made with WordPress, this is not the biggest issue. After looking at their monthly package I discovered that on top of charging a flat price for the website, they charge up to $400 a month for website maintenance. To me this is a clear attempt to sell overpriced add-ons which business owners don't need.



### Canadian Website Design

A quick look at Canadian Website Design's portfolio will show you that this professional agency and their team of developers are going to create a website that looks like a WordPress theme. You will not get a unique design, you will not get a performant website, and you will pay more than you should.



### Site Dudes

If you want the cheapest website possible, buy a WordPress theme and host your own website. If really don't want to touch your own website and instead want the cheapest hands-off option possible you might end up with Site Dudes. The websites created by Site Dudes are some of the worst professional websites I have ever seen. From design, to security, to lack mobile responsiveness. They literally charge $75 dollars a month for websites they created 15 years ago. You can't really beat their price but for that price you are getting some terrible quality.

### Onkyoh Web Designs

Your business needs a website with a clean and modern design that looks good on everything from mobile phones to computer screens. This website should load as fast as possible in order to rank high on Google and capture every visitors attention. Most all it shouldn't break the bank and it should be taken completely off your hands. This is exactly the type of service I provide with the websites I make.



I make sure you get your moneys worth with a high quality website that you can be proud of to represent your business digitally. The best part? You don't need to worry about the website at all, I handle everything from analytics, hosting, and updates.



**When you work with me you work with a developer dedicated to your business, not a business dedicated to making money.**
